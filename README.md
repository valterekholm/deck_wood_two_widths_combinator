=== Fetching the best combination of two board types when planning flooring for balkony ===

This "app" should simplify the desk test (sketch) of combinating two board types when flooring a balkony.

The two widths are stored in variables V1 and V2 and V2 is assumed to be wider than V1.

The idea is to find a numerical combination that yields the smallest/best gap.

The arranging of the boards is not considered here, only the amount of each type.

The question of gap, is a carpenters. I thought that a gap of 2 or 3 mm is good, since the boards might be irregular.

Note: there could be cases when the optimal gap is found with a combination that has 0 of either board type.

Allaho Alem.
